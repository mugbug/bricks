Opinionated flutter package for a micro feature.

## What's Included âœ¨

Out of the box, this template includes:

- âœ… Dependency Injection Structure - Opinionated structure to handle compile-time safe dependency injection between packages via Composition Root pattern.
- âœ… Opinionated code structure to implement a simple feature - The code is already separated in three main folders -- Presentation, Business Logic and Data -- as a suggestion on how to organize the code for your feature.
- âœ… Bloc - Integrated bloc architecture for scalable, testable code which offers a clear separation between business logic and presentation
- âœ… Widget and Unit tests examples for all classes
- âœ… Json Serialization via code gen
- ðŸš§ with more to come soon...
